As the 2024 NBA draft begins tonight, the buzz around potential future stars reaches a fever pitch. Whether youâ€™re a die-hard basketball fan, a fantasy league enthusiast, or a data science lover, the intrigue of predicting the next big stars is undeniable.

I delve deep into the heart of my latest project: a predictive model designed to forecast the outcome of the 2024 NBA draft. Utilizing my own scraper to scrape the historical Draft Combine data from 2000 to 2023 (https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro) and developing machine-learning models to train the historical data, I made my own prediction on this year's NBA draft.

One of the most exciting things about this year's draft is that Bronny James, son of Lebron James, will attend this year's draft. My models also make their own draft prediction for Bronny, but the two models show a totally opposite result. The regression model suggests that Bronny will be drafted in the no.27 pick, but the random forest model suggests that he will be undrafted. 

However, to be honest, I think these two predictions are not accurate at all since there are several drawbacks to the datasets and the models. First of all, Draft Combine data are not intuitive variables for predicting the draft pick since the NBA teams and scouts are not only focused on draft combine but also on playersâ€™ game statistics and potential talent. Also, the method of computing the missing value might not be the best way to reflect the true capabilities of the players and it might mislead the models. Overall, it is an interesting exercise to dive into the magic of sports analytics, and I believe the model will be more developed in the future. ðŸ˜€ 

The figures below are a glimpse of my regression and random forest model prediction. If you want to check the draft prediction of the overall draft class of 2024, welcome to find out more in my blog at Medium (https://medium.com/@michae1420000507) ðŸ˜Ž
